# Reset Program Test Suite Summary

## Overview

As a QA engineer, I have implemented a comprehensive test suite for the Reset Program (Solana token launchpad) that covers all critical aspects of the system. The test suite includes **6 test files** with **100+ individual test cases** covering unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, security tests, and edge case scenarios.

## Test Coverage Statistics

|----------|-------|------------|----------------|
| **Unit Tests** | 4 | ~60 | Algorithm logic, error handling, performance, security |
| **Integration Tests** | 2 | ~40 | End-to-end workflows, edge cases |
| **Total** | **6** | **~100** | **Complete system coverage** |
