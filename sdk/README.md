# Reset Launchpad SDK

A TypeScript SDK for interacting with the Reset Launchpad protocol on Solana. This SDK provides transaction building capabilities for a specific auction without wallet management, allowing frontend applications to handle wallet integration independently.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Single Auction Focus**: SDK is bound to a specific auction during initialization
- ðŸš€ **High-Level API**: Simplified interface with smart caching and auto-resolution
- ðŸ”§ **Low-Level API**: Full control over transaction parameters for advanced use cases
- ðŸ“Š **Data Querying**: Query auction information, user commitments, and statistics
- ðŸš« **No Wallet Management**: Frontend applications handle wallet integration and transaction signing

## Installation

```bash
npm install @reset/sdk
# or
yarn add @reset/sdk
```
